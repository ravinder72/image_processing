I've developed an innovative application using the OpenCV and Pandas libraries. This application employs computer vision techniques to analyze either live webcam footage or input images.
It specializes in detecting edges and contours, intelligently selecting the region with the largest areaâ€”specifically focusing on rectangular shapes.
The magic happens when the selected region is wrapped to produce a flawlessly horizontal image, providing a visually striking output that showcases the latest and most significant portion in vibrant color.
It's a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of OpenCV and Pandas to deliver precise and visually appealing results.
